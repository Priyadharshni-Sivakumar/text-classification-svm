# Text Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Project Description
This project implements a text classification system using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
It demonstrates both linear and non-linear classification of high-dimensional text data.

## Dataset Information
For this project, a custom text dataset was created for demonstration purposes.
The dataset consists of short text samples representing customer feedback.

- Text Data: Customer feedback sentences
- Number of Samples: 10
- Categories:
  - 1 → Positive feedback
  - 0 → Negative feedback

The dataset is defined directly within the Jupyter Notebook and is used to
demonstrate text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification
using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Features
- Text preprocessing using Bag of Words and TF-IDF
- SVM with Linear, RBF, and Polynomial kernels
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search with cross-validation
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Comparison with Random Forest classifier

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file
2. Run all cells sequentially
